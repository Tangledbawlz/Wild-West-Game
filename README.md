# Wild West

A game I am developing in Unreal Engine 4.25. The user is in a Western style land, and the objective is to shoot targets as fast as possible in a competetion with friends. Fastest score time wins!

# Original Idea

Originally, this was going to be a survival game where the user is trying to complete the objectives as fast as possible, and I began running into a few problems. It became difficult, so I changed the game slightly to where the user is competing for quickest time to complete the objective.
